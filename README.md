# New-Sudoku-Solver
Dec-2020
Re-factored the code to work on macOS from the previous Microsoft build.

Changed the fill structure by taking the functions from within the 
original source code and putting them into thier own seperate files using 
the function as the name, which improves overall maintainability. When 
new solving techniques are developed they can be referrenced whilst 
reducing the risk that it affects the main program.

New Functionality List: Find Single Candidates: find single 
candidates in a cell where there are other numbers.

Added a new sentence for new repo!
Added another!!!
And added another!!!!
